# If someone asked you to add '5' and 'potato', you'd probably get confused.
# In computing, this concept is called types. Different variables can have 
# different types. For example:

p = 15
print(type(p))

p = 3.7
print(type(p))

p = "welcome"
print(type(p))

p = []
print(type(p))

# This concept is important because sometimes when performing operations, 
# you may not get the results you want. For example, try these, one line 
# at a time, by un-commenting them (remove the #):

# print(10 + 10)
# print("10" + "10")
# print("10" + 10)
# print(20 / 4)
# print(1 / 5)
# print(1.0 / 5)

# You can also convert between types if necessary.

# print("10" + 5)
# print("10" + str(6))
# print(int("7") + 10)
